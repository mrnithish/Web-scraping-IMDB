# Web-scraping-IMDB

## Overview

This Python project allows you to scrape movie or TV show data from IMDb using BeautifulSoup and requests. You can gather information such as movie ratings, cast, crew, and more.

## Features

- **Scrape IMDb Data**: The script scrapes data for movies, TV shows, or other IMDb content.
- **Customizable URLs**: You can specify IMDb URLs to scrape specific movie or TV show pages.
- **Structured Data**: The scraped data is organized into structured output formats (e.g., JSON, CSV).

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- BeautifulSoup (install via `pip`)
- Requests library (install via `pip`)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrnithish/Web-scraping-IMDB.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Imdb
```

## Usage

1. Modify the script, `scrape.py`, to specify the IMDb URLs you want to scrape. You can customize the URLs for specific movies, TV shows, or other IMDb content.

2. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python imdb_scraper.py
```

- The scraped data will be displayed in the console or saved in a structured output file, depending on your script's configuration.

## Customization

You can customize the script to scrape additional IMDb data by modifying the BeautifulSoup logic in the `imdb_scraper.py` file. For example, you can extract specific information like cast, crew, release date, and more.
